Updated AGENTS.md with the final-response logging rule, and appended this operation summary to codexOutput.md before returning it.

Correct, that behavior was real. The local dedupe entry aged out, and re-scanning old discussion/comment payloads could recreate the mention.

I fixed it by enforcing the 30-day window against the source createdAt when adding mentions. If a mention source is older than 30 days, it is now skipped instead of re-added. I also updated retention pruning to prefer source createdAt (fallback to detectedAt only when needed).

Updated files:

- src/stores/mentionNotificationsStore.ts
- CHANGE_COMMENTS.md

Validation:

- px eslint src/stores/mentionNotificationsStore.ts passed
- px tsc --noEmit passed

Yes. It’s now centralized in src/constants/notifications.constants.ts as MENTION_NOTIFICATION_RETENTION_DAYS (30) and MENTION_NOTIFICATION_RETENTION_MS, and src/stores/mentionNotificationsStore.ts now imports that constant. slint and sc --noEmit both pass.
