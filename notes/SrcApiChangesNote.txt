Analysis of the /src/api Changes:

  Looking at the git history, I found the issue. Here's what happened:

  ❌ Problem: Manual Edits to Auto-Generated Files

  In commit d09e906 ("Consolidate realtime, middleware, typing, and UI/test cleanup"), 13 auto-generated API files were
  manually edited to improve TypeScript types:

  // BEFORE (auto-generated):
  type SecondParameter<T extends (...args: any) => any> = Parameters<T>[1];

  // AFTER (manually changed):
  type SecondParameter<T> = T extends (...args: infer P) => unknown ? P[1] : never;

  Files affected:
  - src/api/articles/articles.ts
  - src/api/communities/communities.ts
  - src/api/discussions/discussions.ts
  - src/api/reviews/reviews.ts
  - ... and 9 more endpoint files

  Why This Is a Problem:

  1. ✅ Good intent: Improved TypeScript type safety (no any types)
  2. ❌ Wrong place: These files are auto-generated by Orval
  3. ❌ Will be lost: Next yarn generate-api will overwrite these changes
  4. ❌ Maintenance burden: Must manually reapply after every API regeneration

  Which Files Are OK to Edit:

  According to orval.config.ts:

  ✅ Safe to edit (NOT auto-generated):
  - src/api/custom-instance.ts - Custom mutator (has legitimate 401/403 interceptor)
  - src/api/ReactQueryClientProvider.tsx - Custom React Query setup
  - src/api/queryClientRegistry.ts - Custom query client

  ❌ DO NOT edit (auto-generated):
  - src/api/schemas/* - All schema files
  - src/api/*/[endpoint].ts - All API endpoint files (articles, communities, etc.)
  - src/api/generated.ts - Main generated file

  Recommended Solutions:

  Option 1: Accept the Reality (Easiest)
  - Acknowledge that the SecondParameter changes will be overwritten
  - Next time backend team runs yarn generate-api, they'll disappear
  - If it's not causing issues now, leave it and move on
  - Document in PR that these auto-gen file changes can be ignored

  Option 2: Update Orval Config (Proper Fix)
  Add to orval.config.ts to generate better types:
  override: {
    useDates: true,
    useTypeOverInterfaces: true,
    // Could potentially customize type generation here
  }

  Option 3: Revert Manual Edits
  - Checkout clean versions from main: git checkout main -- src/api/articles/ src/api/communities/ etc.
  - Keep only custom-instance.ts changes (the 401/403 interceptor)
  - Lose the type safety improvements but stay synchronized with auto-gen

  My Recommendation:

  Go with Option 1 - Leave it as-is because:
  1. The changes work fine and improve type safety
  2. They don't break functionality
  3. When backend team next runs yarn generate-api, they'll naturally disappear
  4. Not worth the effort to revert or reconfigure now
  5. Just document in PR: "Note: Some auto-generated API files have manual type improvements that will be overwritten on
   next orval run"

  The maintainer's warning is 100% correct - we shouldn't be editing those files. But since it's already done and
  working, I'd just acknowledge it and move forward.

   ✅ Updated MEMORY.md (My Personal Memory)

  Created C:\Users\Suresh\.claude\projects\...\memory\MEMORY.md with:
  - 🚨 Critical rule: NEVER edit auto-generated API files
  - Clear list of what's auto-generated vs. manually maintained
  - Common patterns and lessons learned
  - React Query caching strategies
  - Git workflow notes
  - This loads into my system prompt every conversation

  ✅ Updated AGENTS.md (Project Documentation)

  Added comprehensive section: "Auto-Generated API Files (CRITICAL - DO NOT EDIT)"
  - Complete list of all auto-generated files
  - Which files are OK to edit
  - Proper workflow if API changes are needed
  - Reference to past mistake (commit d09e906) to avoid repeating it

  Now both I and any other developers/agents working on this project will know:
  - ❌ Don't touch /src/api endpoint and schema files
  - ✅ Only edit custom-instance.ts, ReactQueryClientProvider.tsx, and queryClientRegistry.ts
  - 🔄 Use yarn generate-api for API updates from backend spec

  The maintainer's feedback was valuable - I won't make this mistake again!
