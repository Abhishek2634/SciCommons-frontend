## 2026-02-27 - Discussion Summary Delete Dialog UX/A11y Hardening

Problem: The new in-app delete confirmation for discussion summaries closed immediately after clicking `Delete`, even before API success, and lacked robust keyboard/focus behavior.

Root Cause: The dialog close state was triggered inside the delete-click handler rather than mutation success, and the modal had no Escape/backdrop-close handling or focus restoration lifecycle.

Solution: Updated `DiscussionSummary` to close the dialog only on successful delete mutation, added guarded Escape key and backdrop-click dismissal, focused the cancel button on open, restored focus on close, and cleaned up dialog markup/loading behavior for consistency.

Result: Delete confirmation now behaves predictably (stays open during API work and errors), keyboard/mouse dismissal is more accessible, and dialog interaction is aligned with expected app UX patterns.

## 2026-02-27 - Zod v4 Compatibility Fix for Profile Validation Build

Problem: After adding `zod` as a direct dependency, Docker/Next builds failed in profile validation with TypeScript errors on `ZodError.errors`.

Root Cause: The code used `result.error.errors[0].message`, which is not available in Zod v4 (uses `issues`).

Solution: Updated profile validation error extraction in `FormInput` and `ResearchInterests` to use `result.error.issues[0]?.message` with safe fallback messages.

Result: Profile validation now compiles correctly with direct `zod@4` and no longer blocks `next build`/Docker build on this API mismatch.

## 2026-02-27 - Profile Validation Consistency Follow-up (Zod + International Names)

Problem: The latest profile-validation commits introduced two consistency issues: name validation still rejected many international names, and the new `schema` prop typing in `FormInput` triggered lint warnings (`no-explicit-any`).

Root Cause: `nameSchema` used an ASCII-only regex (`[a-zA-Z]`), and `FormInput` typed schemas as `ZodSchema<any>`.

Solution: Updated `nameSchema` to use trim + Unicode-aware validation that supports letters/combining marks with internal spaces, apostrophes, and hyphens. Replaced `FormInput` schema typing with `ZodTypeAny` to remove explicit `any`. Added a new regression test suite for valid/invalid `nameSchema` cases.

Result: Profile name validation now aligns with the intended international-name support, lint consistency is restored in shared form input types, and test coverage now guards against future regex regressions.

## 2026-02-26 - Profile Save/Cancel Consistency and Dirty-State Hardening

Problem: The profile edit flow could show stale pre-save data right after a successful save, and dirty-state logic introduced lint/type issues while cancel controls were duplicated in two locations.

Root Cause: The success handler called `reset()` with implicit defaults before refetched user data arrived, dirty checks depended on `any` casting, and both header and footer exposed cancel actions for the same behavior.

Solution: Removed eager post-save `reset()` and kept cache invalidation as the source of truth refresh, made `profilePicture` optional for typed reset defaults, replaced `any`-based dirty checks with typed partial-default comparison, and standardized to a single footer cancel button.

Result: Save now preserves submitted values until canonical refetch, profile dirty-state checks remain lint-clean/type-safe, and edit actions are more consistent with one cancel path.

## 2026-02-26 - Notifications Tab-Aware "New" Indicators + Mention Cleanup Controls

Problem: Notifications UX could not distinguish unseen tab activity across System vs Mentions, bell "New" behavior was mention-only and persisted until read, and Mentions lacked a way to clear historical read entries.

Root Cause: The app tracked unread item state, but did not track per-tab/per-bell seen timestamps for activity acknowledgment; tab titles were count-based only, and mention store exposed no read-mentions bulk cleanup action.

Solution: Added a persisted, user-scoped notification activity store to track seen timestamps for the bell, System tab, and Mentions tab. Updated navbar notifications routing and badge logic to: open Mentions only when Mentions has new activity and System does not; otherwise open System (including both-new and system-only cases). Bell "New" now clears on bell click. Updated notifications page to show tab labels as `System (New)` / `Mentions (New)` for unseen activity on non-active tabs only, and clear those labels when a tab is opened. Added `clearReadMentions` in mention store and a `Clear Read Mentions` button in the Mentions tab.

Result: Notification entry behavior now follows activity-aware tab selection and labeling rules, "New" indicators clear at the expected acknowledgment moments, and users can one-click clear read mentions while keeping unread mentions intact.

Files Modified: `src/stores/notificationActivityStore.ts`, `src/components/common/NavBar.tsx`, `src/app/(main)/(users)/notifications/page.tsx`, `src/stores/mentionNotificationsStore.ts`, `src/components/ui/tab-navigation.tsx`, `CHANGE_COMMENTS.md`

Follow-up (same day): Resolved static-export prerender failure for `/notifications` by moving route entry to a server `page.tsx` Suspense wrapper and shifting client logic (including `useSearchParams`) into `NotificationsPageClient.tsx`.

Follow-up (same day): Removed a redundant nested Suspense wrapper from `NotificationsPageClient.tsx` after introducing the server-level `page.tsx` Suspense boundary, so the route now has a single canonical boundary without behavior changes.

Follow-up (same day): Updated manager join-request actions in System notifications to move cards to the Read section after `Accept`/`Reject` succeeds (success-based transition, no extra manual mark-read step).

Follow-up (same day): Updated Notifications tab "New" labels from plain text suffixes to the existing pill badge style used elsewhere (e.g., navbar/discussions), for consistent visual language.

Follow-up (same day): Refined navbar notifications deep-link routing to choose default tab based on activity since the bell was last seen (not tab-seen history), so mention-only new activity opens `Mentions` while mixed/ system activity opens `System`.

Follow-up (same day): Made the top "Mark All as Read" control active-tab aware: on `System` it marks unread system notifications; on `Mentions` it marks unread mentions, preventing a misleading disabled state when mentions are the only unread items.

Follow-up (same day): Seeded new-owner notification activity timestamps to current time instead of epoch (`0`) so legacy/historical system notifications no longer force `System` tab on first click when current bell activity is mention-only.

Follow-up (same day): Implemented mention deep-link v2 for comment targets. Comment mentions now include `commentId` in navigation links, discussions route parses and propagates that target, comment trees auto-expand the target branch once, scroll to the exact comment, and then clear one-shot target state to avoid repeated forced expansions. Added backward-compatible fallback so older stored mention rows (without `commentId`) still route to the correct comment.

Follow-up (same day): Prevented stale mention regeneration from old threads by enforcing retention against source `createdAt` during mention capture/storage. Mentions older than 30 days are now skipped instead of being re-added after local history cleanup.

Follow-up (same day): Moved mention-retention duration into a shared constant (`src/constants/notifications.constants.ts`) so the 30-day window is centrally configurable and easier to audit.

## 2026-02-26 - Discussions Guest Empty-State Redirect + Private Access Notice

Problem: Logged-out users could open `/discussions` and see an empty sidebar state that looked stale/broken, with no clear direction about private-community access.

Root Cause: The discussions route is intentionally public-routable, while discussion subscriptions are auth-gated; when guest users had no loadable articles, the UI showed a generic empty state.

Solution: Added guest-aware handling in `DiscussionsSidebar`: after auth initialization, if a logged-out user has zero loaded discussion articles, redirect to `/auth/login`. Also added a top informational banner for guests explaining that login unlocks private communities and private discussion subscriptions.

Result: Empty guest discussions states now move users directly to login, and guest users get explicit context about private-access benefits when discussions content is visible.

Files Modified: `src/app/(main)/discussions/DiscussionsSidebar.tsx`, `CHANGE_COMMENTS.md`

## 2026-02-25 - System Notifications Unread/Read Piles + Inline Join-Request Actions

Problem: In the notifications System tab, unread and read items were mixed in one list, and manager-facing join requests required opening a separate page via `View` before admins could approve or reject.

Root Cause: The System tab rendered a uniform notification card without role-aware action handling, and read state changes were only represented as a single per-card button.

Solution: Split System notifications into explicit unread (top) and read (bottom) sections while preserving chronological order inside each section. Added manager join-request detection from notification type/message/link/content metadata, showed target group name on the card, removed `View` for those cards, and added inline `Accept`/`Reject` actions wired to the join-request management endpoint. After action success, the card is marked read, moved to the read section, and displays the final decision state (`Approved`/`Rejected`) on the button.

Result: Users now get clearer System triage with unread-first ordering, own-request notifications naturally move to the lower read pile when marked read, and community admins can process incoming join requests directly from notifications without navigating away.

Follow-up (same day): Kept both manager decision buttons (`Accept` + `Reject`) visible and actionable even after a choice is made, and changed the selected state to button highlighting so admins can revise their decision from the same card. Added a top-level `Mark All as Read` action to bulk-clear unread System notifications in one click.

## 2026-02-25 - Notifications Button Mention Indicator

Problem: New discussion mentions appeared in the Mentions inbox, but the top notifications button had no visible cue that unread mentions existed.

Root Cause: Navbar notifications icon was static and not connected to mention unread state.

Solution: Wired navbar to the mention notification store, scoped entries to the active user, cleaned expired mention records on load, and rendered a compact "New" badge on the notifications button when unread mentions are present.

Result: Users now get a lightweight visual alert for new mentions without numeric counts, and the badge clears once mentions are marked read.

Files Modified: `src/components/common/NavBar.tsx`, `CHANGE_COMMENTS.md`

## 2026-02-25 - Notifications "View" Link Routing Fix (System Tab)

Problem: "View" links in non-mention notifications could open dead destinations instead of navigating to the intended in-app page.

Root Cause: Notification links were always rendered as external anchors after URL sanitization, so relative app paths were treated like off-site URLs.

Solution: Added a safe navigable URL resolver that classifies links as internal vs external, then updated notifications UIs to render Next `Link` for internal paths and external anchors only for off-origin URLs.

Result: System notification "View" links now navigate correctly for in-app routes while retaining safe handling for external links.

## 2026-02-25 - Discussion Mention Capture + Mentions Inbox Tab

Problem: Discussion/comment `@member` mentions were composable in the editor, but there was no in-app mention inbox for recipients, no backend-payload scanning for mentions, and no one-time suppression to avoid duplicate mention alerts.

Root Cause: Mention autocomplete existed only at input time; incoming discussion payloads (initial loads + realtime) were not parsed for current-user mentions, and the notifications page had no mention-specific view/state model.

Solution: Added shared mention parsing and capture helpers, plus a persisted per-user mention store with unread/read state, dedupe-by-source keys, and 30-day retention cleanup. Wired mention scanning into discussion list fetches, recursive discussion comment-tree fetches, and realtime `new_*`/`updated_*` discussion-comment events. Added discussion-thread deep-link support via `discussionId` query param in discussions split view (`/discussions?articleId=...&discussionId=...`). Reworked `/notifications` into a tabbed interface with `System` and `Mentions`; mention items are grouped into unread/read sections and move to read when clicked.

Result: Mention recipients now get durable, non-toast mention entries with one-click navigation to the relevant discussion thread, and each mention source is surfaced only once within a rolling 30-day window.

## 2026-02-25 - Discussions Split View Default Selection on First Load

Problem: On initial load of the discussions page, the right panel could remain empty until the user manually selected an article from the left sidebar.

Root Cause: Selection restore logic only handled explicit `articleId` URL params and had no fallback for first-load scenarios without that param.

Solution: Updated discussions initialization to select an article once in deterministic priority order: URL `articleId`, session-stored last selected discussion article, previously read article from `readItemsStore.clearedArticles`, then the top article. Persisted selected article id in session storage during both initialization and manual selection.

Result: The discussions right panel now auto-populates reliably on first load, while still honoring deep links and previous context when available.

## 2026-02-25 - Community Split-View Preview Selection Override Fix

Problem: In the community two-panel articles view, clicking a non-top article could still show the top article in the right preview panel.

Root Cause: URL-driven restoration logic re-applied selection too aggressively and could override manual click selection during subsequent state/query-param updates.

Solution: Hardened preview selection sync in `CommunityArticles`: read current query params from `window.location.search` when updating `articleId`, restore from URL only when the requested id actually changes, reset restore state on search, and key the right-panel `ArticleContentView` by selected article id.

Result: Clicking any article in community preview mode now keeps the right panel aligned with the clicked card instead of snapping back to the first item.

## 2026-02-25 - Community-Member `@mention` Suggestions in Discussion Comments

Problem: Discussion comments/replies did not provide guided `@name` tagging, so users had to guess exact member names and could not reliably mention the intended community member.

Root Cause: Discussion comment inputs were plain textareas with no mention-token parsing or candidate source from the community API.

Solution: Added mention-autocomplete behavior to the shared discussion comment input flow: typing `@` followed by letters now parses an active mention token, filters candidates in real time, and inserts the selected name via keyboard or mouse. Wired `DiscussionForum` to fetch the active community payload and derive `members` as normalized mention candidates, then passed those candidates through discussion-only comment components (new comment, reply, edit, nested replies).

Result: In community discussions, users now get continuously filtered `@member` suggestions while typing in comments/replies, with no impact on non-discussion comment surfaces.

Follow-up (same day): Extended `@mention` suggestions to discussion markdown content editors (new + edit) by wiring mention candidates through `DiscussionForm`/discussion edit forms -> `FormInput` -> MDX editor wrapper and adding caret-based mention detection + suffix insertion in the markdown editor component.

Follow-up (same day): Hardened mention menu UX near viewport edges by adding dynamic above/below placement and constrained max-height in both textarea and markdown editors, and synchronized arrow-key highlight with list scrolling so the active option stays visible.

## 2026-02-25 - Add External Destination Links for Home Supporter Logos

Problem: The four supporter logos on the homepage were visual-only and did not navigate to the supporters' websites.

Root Cause: The supporters block rendered plain image components without outbound anchor/link wrappers.

Solution: Wrapped each supporter logo group with an external link and mapped URLs as follows: KCDHA -> Ashoka Koita Centre, DRAC -> Digital Research Alliance of Canada, GSoC -> Google Summer of Code, INCF -> INCF.

Result: Users can now click/tap each supporter logo to open the correct supporter page in a new tab.

Files Modified: `src/app/(home)/page.tsx`, `CHANGE_COMMENTS.md`

## 2026-02-25 - Add INCF to Home Supporters and Split Supporters into Two Rows

Problem: The homepage supporters section did not include the newly provided INCF logo, and a single desktop row was becoming visually long.

Root Cause: The supporters block in `src/app/(home)/page.tsx` was hard-coded as a horizontal row at `sm` breakpoints and had no INCF image entry.

Solution: Moved the provided `incf.png` asset into `public/images/INCF.png`, added an INCF logo image in the supporters list, and changed the supporters logo layout to a responsive grid (1 column on mobile, 2 columns from `sm` onward).

Result: INCF now appears in the front-page "Our Supporters" section, and desktop/tablet rendering is balanced across two rows instead of one long strip.

## 2026-02-24 - Community Admin Requests Split into Pending and Approved Tabs

Problem: The admin `Requests` screen showed a mixed history by default, so pending join requests were buried alongside previously approved entries.

Root Cause: The page used a status dropdown with broad filtering (`All` by default) rather than focused, workflow-oriented tabs.

Solution: Replaced the dropdown with the shared `TabComponent` style used across community/admin pages and mapped two explicit tabs (`Pending`, `Approved`) to strict status filters (`pending`, `approved`).

Result: Admins now get a cleaner workflow: pending requests are isolated for action, while approved requests are available in a separate history tab using consistent site tab styling.

## 2026-02-24 - Login Path Compatibility Redirect

Problem: Session-expiration flows could send users to `/login`, but the actual login page is `/auth/login`, causing a 404 on stale links/routes.

Root Cause: The app’s canonical auth route moved under `/auth/login`, while compatibility handling for legacy `/login` paths was missing.

Solution: Added a dedicated `/login` route that redirects to `/auth/login` and preserves existing query parameters (including redirect targets).

Result: Users who land on `/login` are now safely routed to the correct auth page instead of seeing 404.

Files Modified: `src/app/login/page.tsx`, `CHANGE_COMMENTS.md`

## 2026-02-24 - Localmodal Delete Confirm Dialog Hardening (Review + Comment)

Problem: The localmodal delete confirmations for reviews/comments could render behind fixed mobile navigation and lacked complete dialog accessibility semantics.

Root Cause: Both overlays used `z-50` while fixed mobile UI uses much higher z-indices, and dialog containers did not declare `role="dialog"`/`aria-modal`/label associations. The comment modal also used ad-hoc button styling instead of shared tokenized button variants.

Solution: Raised modal overlay layers to `z-[1100]`, added ARIA dialog semantics (`role`, `aria-modal`, `aria-labelledby`, `aria-describedby`) in both modals, and switched comment modal actions to shared `Button` components (`gray`/`danger`) for consistency.

Result: Delete confirmations now consistently sit above fixed UI on mobile, are better announced by assistive technologies, and align with existing design-token/button patterns.

## 2026-02-24 - Profile Image Picker Targeting Hardening

Problem: The profile photo edit button clicked a globally queried `input[name="profilePicture"]`, which could target the wrong element if another matching input existed.

Root Cause: The trigger logic depended on `document.querySelector(...)` instead of the specific file input rendered by the `Profile` component.

Solution: Replaced global selector usage with a component-local input ref while preserving react-hook-form registration behavior by forwarding the registered ref callback.

Result: The profile image edit action now reliably opens the correct file picker and is resilient to future form composition changes.

Files Modified: `src/app/(main)/(users)/myprofile/Profile.tsx`, `CHANGE_COMMENTS.md`

## 2026-02-23 - My Communities Membership Source + Elevated Role Badges

Problem: The `My Communities` tab needed to be aligned with the new `/my-communities` behavior (membership list) while still showing whether the user is also an Admin, Moderator, or Reviewer in each community.

Root Cause: The tab rendered plain community cards from the base list response only, with no role overlay metadata in card UI.

Solution: Kept `My Communities` list sourcing from unfiltered `/my-communities`, added parallel role-filtered lookups (`admin`, `moderator`, `reviewer`) to build role membership sets, and passed compact role badges (`A`, `M`, `R`) into `CommunityCard` for top-right rendering. Added accessible labeling for each badge.

Result: `My Communities` now reflects membership-focused listing while clearly indicating elevated roles per card in an accessible, compact format.

Follow-up (same day): Extended the same role markers to the `Communities` tab, added member-only `m` marker support, introduced accessible non-member access dots (green for public, red for private), and sorted visible cards in reading order by role priority (`Admin`, `Moderator`, `Reviewer`, `Member`, then non-members with `public` before `private`).

## 2026-02-23 - Community Article Detail List-View Shortcut

Problem: From community article detail pages (for example `/community/{slug}/articles/{articleSlug}`), returning to the community article listing required breadcrumb navigation without an explicit list-mode shortcut.

Root Cause: The detail page header only rendered breadcrumbs and tabs; it had no direct action to switch back to the community articles list view state.

Solution: Added a right-aligned `List View` button in the community article detail page header. The action routes back to `/community/{slug}` (preserving current `articleId` in query) and sets the shared articles view store to `grid` before navigation so users land in list mode.

Result: Users now have a one-click convenience control to return from article detail pages to community list mode, consistent with existing view-switching patterns.

Follow-up (same day): Made the action icon-only on small screens while retaining the text label on larger screens, added explicit accessibility labeling/tooltip, and switched to `Button asChild` with `Link` to avoid nested interactive elements.

## 2026-02-22 - Professional Status Validation and Mobile Layout Hardening (pr-280 follow-up)

Problem: The professional status update allowed malformed end-year values to pass submit-time validation, and the new single-row layout could compress/overflow on smaller screens.

Root Cause: End-year pattern validation was removed while submit checks relied on loose numeric conversion; the row layout switched from responsive grid to fixed-width flex items without a mobile wrap fallback.

Solution: Restored strict 4-digit `End Year` validation in `ProfessionalStatus`, kept ordering checks, added responsive `flex-wrap` fallback for the row, added an explicit `aria-label` on the icon-only remove action, and aligned submit-time year validation in `page.tsx` to enforce numeric 4-digit years for both start/end.

Result: Invalid year strings are now blocked consistently before mutation, the professional status row behaves better on narrow screens, and icon-only remove controls are explicitly accessible.

Files Modified: `src/app/(main)/(users)/myprofile/ProfessionalStatus.tsx`, `src/app/(main)/(users)/myprofile/page.tsx`, `CHANGE_COMMENTS.md`

## 2026-02-22 - ProfessionalStatus Type-Safe End-Year Validation Follow-up

Problem: The latest profile status end-year fix introduced a TypeScript compile regression in `ProfessionalStatus.tsx`.

Root Cause: `useFormContext<IProfileForm>()` made nested field paths strongly typed, but `FormInput` currently accepts `name` as `keyof IProfileForm` (top-level keys only), so nested names like `professionalStatuses.0.endYear` failed type-check.

Solution: Kept strict form context typing and introduced explicit field-name constants cast at the `FormInput` boundary for nested array paths. Also made year parsing explicit with base-10 radix to keep validation behavior deterministic.

Result: End-year validation remains in place, and the profile module now passes TypeScript and eslint checks without widening form types back to `any`.

## 2026-02-22 - Centered 404 Quick-Link Cards (Home/Go Back)

Problem: On the 404 page, the `Home` and `Go Back` quick-link cards were not visually centered in the "Still need help?" section.

Root Cause: The layout remained `sm:grid-cols-3` after the `Articles` quick-link card was hidden, so only two cards rendered in a three-column grid.

Solution: Updated the quick-links grid in `not-found.tsx` to use a centered, constrained two-column layout (`mx-auto`, `max-w-xl`, `sm:grid-cols-2`).

Result: The `Home` and `Go Back` cards now render centered as a balanced row on small and larger screens.

Files Modified: `src/app/not-found.tsx`, `CHANGE_COMMENTS.md`

## 2026-02-21 - Centralized Reviews Tab Body Across Article, Community, and Discussions

Problem: Review-tab UI behavior (notice text, add/cancel review toggle, review form, loading/empty/list states) was duplicated across multiple routes, so small copy updates and UX tweaks had to be repeated manually.

Root Cause: Route containers evolved separately (`ArticleDisplayPageClient`, community article page, and shared article content used in discussions), but each still embedded its own review-tab rendering instead of composing a shared review body.

Solution: Added `ReviewsTabBody` component to centralize the full review-tab body, including the canonical review notice text (`REVIEW_NOTICE_TEXT`). Rewired `ArticleContentView`, article display route, and community article route to use this shared component while preserving route-specific behavior through props (for example, PDF quote notice in the article route and community scope on community pages).

Result: Review-tab behavior now has one implementation path, the notice copy is managed from one place, and future review UX changes can be made once and propagated consistently across article/community/discussions contexts.

## 2026-02-20 - Discussion Overflow Follow-up After PR #271

Problem: After merging PR #271, discussion summary/thread text wrapping still had a quality gap: one thread container used malformed JSX attributes instead of `className`, and the shared `TruncateText` helper was globally forced to `break-all`, causing unintended typography changes outside discussions.

Root Cause: The overflow fix mixed local layout constraints with a global text-helper override, and one JSX node used raw utility tokens as attributes (`<div break-all min-w-0 ...>`) so styles did not apply as intended.

Solution: Reverted the global `TruncateText` base class back to neutral behavior, then applied wrapping constraints only where needed in discussion surfaces (`DiscussionCard`, `DiscussionSummary`, `DiscussionThread`) using `break-words` plus `overflow-wrap:anywhere`. Corrected the malformed thread `<div>` to a valid `className` and passed explicit wrap classes into `TruncateText` calls used by discussion previews.

Result: Discussion content/topic previews now wrap consistently in both split and full-page discussion views without container overflow, while non-discussion pages keep their prior text rendering behavior.

## 2026-02-19 - Ctrl/Cmd+Enter Submit for FormInput Textareas

Problem: Ctrl/Cmd+Enter submission did not consistently work in abstract edit fields and other textarea-based forms.

Root Cause: Keyboard submit behavior depended on form-level hooks, but some textarea flows relied only on `FormInput` without centralized textarea key handling.

Solution: Added direct Ctrl/Cmd+Enter handling for plain `FormInput` textareas to submit their parent form, and updated the global `useSubmitOnCtrlEnter` hook to ignore already-handled key events.

Result: Keyboard submit now works reliably in edit abstract fields and other `FormInput` textarea contexts, without double-submitting in forms that also use the global hook.

Files Modified: `src/components/common/FormInput.tsx`, `src/hooks/useSubmitOnCtrlEnter.ts`

## 2026-02-19 - Faster Article Settings Completion and Context-Preserving Return

Problem: Updating article details from side-panel list views felt slow and redirected users to a different page context instead of returning to where they started.

Root Cause: Settings save flow relied on generic `returnTo` routing and post-save cache work before perceived completion, without an explicit return-path to list/preview context.

Solution: Added explicit `returnPath` propagation from article panel contexts into the settings link, then prioritized immediate redirect to that safe internal path on update success. Moved cache invalidation to asynchronous post-redirect execution and improved pending button feedback text.

Result: After update, users return directly to the originating list/preview context (for example, community/articles/discussions panels with selected `articleId`), and completion feels faster because navigation happens immediately on success.

## 2026-02-19 - Community Article Deep-Link Selection by articleId

Problem: Opening a community URL with `?articleId={id}` loaded the correct community but preview auto-opened the first/top article instead of the requested one.

Root Cause: `CommunityArticles` had no query-param restoration flow for preview selection, while keyboard navigation auto-selected the first article when preview mode was active.

Solution: Added `articleId` parsing from URL query params, restored selected preview article once list data is available, and disabled first-item auto-selection when an explicit `articleId` is present.

Result: Deep links like `/community/GSoC%202026?articleId=318` now open the specified article in the preview panel (when present in the loaded list).

Files Modified: `src/app/(main)/(communities)/community/[slug]/(displaycommunity)/CommunityArticles.tsx`

## 2026-02-19 - Community Articles Left Panel Scrollbar Restoration

Problem: In community `Articles` split/preview view, the left articles list panel did not show a scrollbar and was difficult to scroll through with mouse/trackpad.

Root Cause: `ResizablePanel` applies inline `overflow: hidden`; in `CommunityArticles` this was not overridden, so class-based `overflow-y-auto` did not reliably produce a scrollable panel UI.

Solution: Updated the left panel container to use a fixed height and added explicit `style={{ overflow: 'auto' }}` to override the panel's inline overflow behavior.

Result: The left articles panel now shows a scrollbar and supports normal pointer-based scrolling through long lists.

## 2026-02-19 - Discussion Entity Artifacts and Vote Label Clarity

Problem: Discussion topic/content text displayed raw HTML entities like `&#x20` at line ends, and thread vote controls showed a bare `0` that appeared as an unclear `< 0 >` marker on the right side.

Root Cause: Discussion fields were rendered/reset as raw strings from API payloads without HTML-entity decoding, and vote UI presented only the numeric likes count with no context when the value was zero.

Solution: Added a shared `decodeHtmlEntities` utility in `src/lib/htmlEntities.ts` and applied it in discussion card/thread render paths plus edit-form reset defaults so escaped entities are normalized before display. Updated thread vote text to an explicit label (`{n} votes` or `Vote`) instead of a standalone number.

Result: Discussion text no longer leaks encoded entity artifacts in list/thread views, and the right-side vote widget now reads clearly rather than appearing as stray symbols around `0`.

Files Modified: `src/lib/htmlEntities.ts`, `src/components/articles/DiscussionCard.tsx`, `src/components/articles/DiscussionThread.tsx`, `src/tests/__tests__/htmlEntities.test.ts`

Follow-up (same day): Temporarily commented out the thread vote value display in `DiscussionThread` per product request, keeping only upvote/downvote buttons visible.

## 2026-02-18 - Home Supporters Strip GSoC Vertical Alignment

Problem: In the homepage supporters row, the GSoC logo appeared slightly lower than KCDHA and DRAC in desktop layout.

Root Cause: The GSoC image asset's internal bounding box/padding produced a visual baseline offset relative to neighboring logos.

Solution: Added a small desktop-only upward translation (`sm:-translate-y-px`) to both dark and light GSoC logo variants in the supporters strip.

Result: The three supporter logos now appear visually aligned on the same row.

Files Modified: `src/app/(home)/page.tsx`

## 2026-02-18 - Add DRAC to Home Supporters Strip

Problem: The homepage supporters row did not include the newly provided DRAC supporter branding.

Root Cause: `src/app/(home)/page.tsx` rendered only KCDHA and GSoC logos, with no DRAC entries in the supporter image list.

Solution: Added DRAC logos to the supporters row using the same light/dark theme switch pattern already used by other supporters (`dark:block` + `dark:hidden` image pair).

Result: DRAC now appears in the "Our Supporters" section on the homepage and switches correctly between dark and light themes.

## 2026-02-18 - Docker Build Stability Without Google Fonts Network Access

Problem: `docker compose ... up --build` could fail during `next build` in environments where outbound access to Google Fonts is restricted.

Root Cause: `src/app/layout.tsx` used `next/font/google` (`Manrope` and `Space Grotesk`), which triggers build-time requests to `fonts.googleapis.com`.

Solution: Removed `next/font/google` usage from the root layout and defined `--font-sans` / `--font-display` local fallback stacks in `globals.css` so typography remains stable without remote font fetches.

Result: Frontend builds no longer depend on live Google Fonts access, which improves Docker/CI reliability on restricted networks.

Files Modified: `src/app/layout.tsx`, `src/app/globals.css`

## 2026-02-18 - Community Rules Update Payload Type Alignment

Problem: Running `tsc --skipLibCheck --noEmit` failed with TS2353 in admin rules settings because the update payload included unknown properties.

Root Cause: `AddRules.tsx` sent `tags` and `about` inside `payload.details`, but `UpdateCommunityDetails` only accepts `description`, `type`, `rules`, and optional `community_settings`.

Solution: Updated `AddRules` submit payload to match `UpdateCommunityDetails`, removed unsupported properties, and forwarded existing `community_settings` to preserve current configuration while updating rules.

Result: Type-check now succeeds, lint remains clean, and rules updates are aligned with the generated API schema contract.

Files Modified: `src/app/(main)/(communities)/community/[slug]/(admin)/settings/AddRules.tsx`

## 2026-02-17 - Realtime Logout Abort for In-Flight Poll

Problem: Logging out could still leave one realtime long-poll request active for up to the poll timeout window.

Root Cause: `useRealtime` logout teardown disabled future polling and cleared queue state, but did not abort the currently in-flight poll `fetch` request or clear the pending poll timeout callback.

Solution: Updated logout teardown in `useRealtime` to explicitly abort the active `AbortController` and clear/reset `pollTimeoutRef` before releasing leadership and marking realtime disabled.

Result: Logout now cuts the realtime poll connection immediately instead of waiting for the server response or timeout.

Files Modified: `src/hooks/useRealtime.tsx`

## 2026-02-17 - Comment Toolbars Compaction (Discussion/Review/Post)

Problem: Comment sections consumed extra vertical space because controls were split across multiple rows (including a redundant `Comments:` heading in discussion/review views).

Root Cause: Comment UIs were implemented with separate header and control rows instead of a single compact toolbar, and spacing patterns diverged across discussion, review, and post contexts.

Solution: Refactored comment toolbars to a compact single-row pattern: keep `Add Comment` on the left and place `Depth` + `Expand/Collapse All` controls on the same row when comments exist; removed the superfluous `Comments:` heading where present. Followed up with a small margin tweak above expanded review comments so the toolbar sits with clearer separation from the review card's `{n} comments` toggle row.

Result: Discussion, review, and post comment panes now use less vertical space and behave more consistently while preserving all existing thread controls.

## 2026-02-17 - Discussions/Comments NEW Auto-Expand Hardening (Phase 1)

Problem: NEW badges were visible in discussion/comment flows, but unread discussion threads were not consistently auto-expanding to reveal new activity.

Root Cause: Auto-open logic in `DiscussionCard` depended on `comments_count` being present and greater than zero; when that count was omitted, unread cards with NEW badges stayed collapsed.

Solution: Replayed the discussion/comment unread improvements from `combinedarticlediscussionnewtags` and hardened auto-expand behavior. Added unread-aware expansion plumbing (`autoExpandOnUnread`) through `DiscussionComments` and `RenderComments`, restored subtree unread detection and reply-level NEW badges in `Comment`, and updated `DiscussionCard` to auto-open for unread items unless comment count is explicitly `0` while resetting the one-time guard when unread clears. Added realtime propagation in `useRealtime` so `new_comment` events also mark the parent discussion as ephemeral unread. Updated `useMarkAsReadOnView` with discussion-specific realtime handling so parent discussion NEW can reappear after prior reads without passively clearing the article-level NEW summary badge.

Result: Discussion/comment NEW indicators and unread-path expansion now work together more reliably, including cases where backend discussion counts are missing.

Files Modified: `src/components/articles/DiscussionCard.tsx`, `src/components/articles/DiscussionComments.tsx`, `src/components/common/RenderComments.tsx`, `src/components/common/Comment.tsx`, `src/hooks/useRealtime.tsx`, `src/hooks/useMarkAsReadOnView.ts`

## 2026-02-16 - Docker Compose Build Args from .env

Problem: Local Docker Compose workflow required manually passing build args and could miss theme-related variables.

Root Cause: `docker-compose.dev.yml` only referenced an image tag and had no `build.args` mapping; `Dockerfile` did not inject `NEXT_PUBLIC_UI_SKIN` during build.

Solution: Added `build` configuration in `docker-compose.dev.yml` with args mapped from repo `.env` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_REALTIME_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_UI_SKIN`. Updated `Dockerfile` to accept and write `NEXT_PUBLIC_UI_SKIN` into build-time `.env`.

Result: `docker compose` can now rebuild the frontend image using `.env` values consistently, including UI skin selection.

Files Modified: `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `Dockerfile`
