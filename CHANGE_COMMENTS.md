## 2026-02-16 - Docker Compose Build Args from .env

Problem: Local Docker Compose workflow required manually passing build args and could miss theme-related variables.

Root Cause: `docker-compose.dev.yml` only referenced an image tag and had no `build.args` mapping; `Dockerfile` did not inject `NEXT_PUBLIC_UI_SKIN` during build.

Solution: Added `build` configuration in `docker-compose.dev.yml` with args mapped from repo `.env` for `NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_REALTIME_URL`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_UI_SKIN`. Updated `Dockerfile` to accept and write `NEXT_PUBLIC_UI_SKIN` into build-time `.env`.

Result: `docker compose` can now rebuild the frontend image using `.env` values consistently, including UI skin selection.

Files Modified: `docker-compose.dev.yml`, `Dockerfile`
