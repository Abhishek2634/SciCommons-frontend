# Change Commentary (Baseline 5271498 -> Current Tree)

This document captures the *behavioral* and *structural* differences between the tree at
commit `5271498` (the commit immediately before the first `bsureshkrishna` change on 2026-02-07)
and the current working tree. It is intentionally high-level: it focuses on what the current
code now does, not a commit-by-commit history.

**Auth, Session, and Security Hardening**
1. Auth initialization now migrates persisted auth into cookies, validates expiry, probes the
   server once for a fallback session, and clears caches/unread state on logout.
2. Middleware now guards protected routes via `auth_token` + `expiresAt` cookies and redirects
   unauthenticated users to login with a return URL.
3. Axios requests now sanitize invalid `Authorization` headers (e.g., `Bearer null`) to prevent
   noisy 401s and downstream failures.
4. External links are sanitized via `getSafeExternalUrl` to block unsafe schemes.

**Realtime + Unread Notifications**
1. Realtime polling now persists queue state (`queue_id`, `last_event_id`) and uses multi-tab
   leader election with BroadcastChannel to avoid duplicate processing.
2. Events update React Query caches and feed a persisted unread store that drives badges, sorting,
   and mark-as-read behavior.
3. Unread items can be marked read by viewport dwell (IntersectionObserver) or explicit actions.
4. Notification toasts + optional sound hooks are wired to user settings.

**Bookmarks + Article/Community Surfaces**
1. Article and community cards now support bookmark toggles with optimistic UI updates.
2. Article preview moved to hover-based tooltip for compact lists, keeping click for navigation.
3. Community and article routes now consistently encode community slugs for safe URLs.

**Communities, Discussions, and Admin Workflows**
1. Community header surfaces join flow, pending request counts (admin), and settings shortcuts.
2. Discussion cards add unread highlighting, mark-as-read hooks, and resolve/unresolve actions
   for admins/authors.
3. A new discussion summary flow lets admins create/edit/delete collapsible summaries.
4. Subscriptions sidebar merges unread activity with user subscriptions and sorts by recency.

**Content Rendering + Safety**
1. Centralized `RenderParsedHTML` now sanitizes with DOMPurify and supports Markdown + LaTeX,
   with optional "show more" truncation and heading flattening.
2. Community/Article summaries use parsed HTML consistently with safety defaults.

**PDF Annotations**
1. PDF viewer components provide highlight capture, notes, and quote-to-review interactions.
2. Annotations persist locally (Zustand + localStorage) with export/import scaffolding.

**User Settings**
1. User settings are fetched, cached, and stored locally to drive preferences such as notification
   sound and email toggles.

**Platform/Config/Test Infrastructure**
1. Next.js config tightened security headers, image optimization allowlist, and PWA caching defaults.
2. Standalone build helper copies `public/` and `.next/static` to ensure assets in deployment.
3. Jest config updated for jsdom and expanded tests (auth, middleware, realtime, UI).
4. Repository standardized on `yarn.lock` (package-lock removed).

**Post-Commentary Follow-ups (After 93c19fe)**
1. Fixed a missing `accessToken` destructure in the Articles tab content to enable authenticated
   queries and eliminate TypeScript errors.
2. Simplified the Tabler icon wrapper to avoid ref type mismatches in strict typing.
3. Forced `canvas@3.2.1` via Yarn `resolutions` to avoid Node 22 binary issues from transitive deps.
4. Minor formatting-only normalization in a few files (no behavioral changes).

If you want deeper traceability, use `git diff 5271498..HEAD` for exact code deltas.
