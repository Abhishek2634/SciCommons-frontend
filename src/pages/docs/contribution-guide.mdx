# Contributing to Our Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We have two main repositories: one for the frontend and one for the backend. This guide will help you contribute to both.

## Project Structure

Our project is divided into two main repositories:

1. Frontend: https://github.com/m2b3/SciCommons-frontend
2. Backend: https://github.com/m2b3/SciCommons-backend

## Code of Conduct

3. Set up the development environment:
   ```
   cd frontend
   yarn install
   ```
4. Create a branch for your changes:
   ```
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

### For Backend Development

### Pull Requests

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md in the relevant repository with details of changes.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
4. You may merge the Pull Request once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Style Guidelines

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Frontend Style Guide

We use Husky and lint-staged to enforce our frontend code style:

* ESLint is configured to catch and fix JavaScript/TypeScript issues
* TypeScript compiler checks for type errors
* Prettier ensures consistent code formatting

These checks run automatically on staged files when you commit. If there are any issues, the commit will be blocked until you fix them.

### Backend Style Guide

We use pre-commit hooks to maintain our backend code quality:

* Flake8 checks for Python code style and quality issues
* Black automatically formats Python code
* isort sorts Python imports

Before committing, run the following command to apply these checks to all files:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This will ensure your code adheres to our style guidelines before you commit.

### General Guidelines

* Write clear, readable, and self-documenting code
* Include comments for complex logic, but prefer clear code over excessive comments
* Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes

## Testing

* For frontend, run tests with: `yarn test`
* For backend, run tests with: `poetry run python manage.py test`

Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.
